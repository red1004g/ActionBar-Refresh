## OVERVIEW

- This project has been rebuilt to [Android-PullToRefresh](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh) not using gradle.
- ActionBar-Refresh is only supporting to [android-support-v7](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html#libs-with-res) yet. (It is scheduled to add ActionBarSherlock later)

__example is not pushed currently. That will be pushed soon.__
